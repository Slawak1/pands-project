### Objectives

Project concern Fisher’s Iris data set. 
[Project description in PDF](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/raw/master/project.pdf)

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.


### Tools

To analyse Iris Data Set I work with Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook.

#### Used Libraries and tools

##### Pandas
Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. The two primary data structures of pandas, Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering.

##### NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities, Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

##### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For examples, see the sample plots and thumbnail gallery.

##### Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures. [https://seaborn.pydata.org/](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

##### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

##### statsmodels
statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.[http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/index.html](http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/index.html)
